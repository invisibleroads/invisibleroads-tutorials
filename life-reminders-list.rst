books
-----
| 2005-04-21
| walking through the shelves of a library
| I look at the books sadly
| and with longing.
| How unjust!
| Lack of time
| and lack of intelligence
| deny me the pleasure of wisdom.


where we want to be
-------------------
| 2006-09-16
| If this is not the life we wanted,
| what can we do today to help us tomorrow?
| Teams, agreements, goals, plans, schedules.


exert for freedom
-----------------
| 2008-07-17
| If you are slow, they will drag you. If you can find the energy to run ahead, then you can make your path. If only we remember what we wanted to do when trapped instead of being distracted when free. Have the strength to stay focused and save yourself.


revise goals

| 2009-09-11
| Years are passing.
| Let us renew
| why we are here
| what we came to do.


before hunger 
-------------
| 2009-12-16
| Before hunger makes me forget my directions, while I can still see dimly with one eye, let me write a list of what I need to do, and program myself to stick to this list to ensure that I will execute it even when I lose the ability to reprogram myself because my prefrontal cortex has shut down to save energy.


how to contribute
-----------------
| 2010-06-09
| Emergency disconnect. My world is upside down today!
| Think, "I have experienced this before."
| Run checklist.
| Eat. Did you eat more than four hours ago?
| Sleep. Rest your broken body.
| Exercise.
| Write in journal. Don't show anyone.
| Talk meaningfully with confidante, even a stranger.
| Say, "I can do it."
| Say, "I can do it!"
| List today's goals. Be reasonable. 
| What can we do today to help us tomorrow?
| Teamwork starts with taking care of yourself.

a woman needs to feel safe
--------------------------
| 2011-12-19
| A passenger can sit comfortably if she trusts the ability of the driver.
| She might overtake the steering wheel in an emergency, but does not like to do this all the time.
| It is not enough for the driver to behave as though he knows what he is doing, for the passenger can sense whether they are headed in the right direction.
| A person becomes a better driver through experience.
| Experienced drivers easily gain the trust of their passengers.


active optimism
---------------
| 2012-01-23
| If love is about negotiating a way to fulfill both people's needs, then maybe friendship is about sharing experiences and showing interest in the lives of others.  It is natural to lose connection with people, no matter how close was the bond.  Replenishing and cultivating your garden of friends are lifelong activities.  Remind yourself that it is worth the effort and that it is never too late as long as you are alive.  Think good thoughts about others.  Work with what you have, even if it is imperfect.  Moving forward does not mean you have to start over.

| Start with something simple but complete

no illusions
------------

| Hard work is ahead, 
| but I will make it rewarding 
| for those with whom I work and 
| for those I love.

| 2013-03-01
| For each goal, decide the next step.

------------------------------------
| 2013-11-27
| A relationship is an agreement between two parties on what you will do for me in exchange for what I do for you, with boundaries on which activities and information can be shared with other parties and which activities and information must be exclusive for the agreement to hold.  Givers try to negotiate by offering more costs.  Takers try to negotiate by demanding more benefits.

involve other people in your work

reach life goals
----------------
| 2014-02-02
| When overwhelmed with work, I might schedule too much for one day in the wishful hope that I will magically get it all done.  This is a false and unfair promise.  It is not how much I get done, but whether I am doing what is essential toward a long-term goal.
| If I reach only one goal today, which one will take me closest to where I want to be?
| Ask people to do specific tasks.
| Describe a ten-minute mission and cross it out when done.


minimize damages

| 2014-02-06

give feedback privately

perfectionism is lethal

| 2014-08-03
| People will not wait for your work to be perfect.
| Have the courage to act even if the details are incomplete.


paths vs goals
--------------
| 2014-08-12
| Reminding yourself of a path that needs work is more effective than criticizing yourself on a goal.
| The secret to staying focused is to take breaks.


passion vs dedication
---------------------
| 2014-08-30
| Would you stay in a job that makes you unhappy? I was in a serious relationship for over seven years and stayed with several employers for much longer than necessary. I thought dedication was more important. I have since left these toxic relationships and am leading a much happier life. From experience, I can emphatically say that passion is key to success in any endeavor.


female attraction

| 2014-09-04

| That is how you show love to me.


plan to get what you want
-------------------------
| 2014-12-12
| If I don't plan and make clear to myself my own goals and what I want,

| Plan to prepare myself to get what I want.
| Stay true to what you want to do.


ask myself
----------
| 2014-12-13
| Instead of telling myself what to do, ask what I feel like doing and do that instead.
| If I keep getting distracted, then my brain and body are trying to tell me something.
| Write in my notebook, "What would I like to do now?"
| After writing three options, circle one and do it.
| Draw a line through the completed task and ask yourself the question again.
| Asking questions restores control.
| Listing options prevents impulsiveness.


consult the locals
------------------
| 2014-12-14
| Before getting in a taxi, ask nearby locals how much the trip will cost.
| If there is no meter, settle the trip cost with the driver beforehand.

| With distance, comes distance.

right for me
------------

| 2015-01-07
| Write a baby step.
| Promise a reward.


habits

| 2015-01-13
| Maybe the key to progress is not goals but habits.
| Habits are what enable you to reach your goals.


assert and defend
-----------------
| 2015-05-03
| If I decide that a request is not in my best interest, then I need to say no firmly and stick to it, regardless of what the other person says or does or how many times the person asks.
| If the other person proceeds to do what is not in my best interest, then I need to respond and act strongly to respect and defend what is important to me.
| It is foolish to give in, sacrifice what I want and then seethe afterwards.  If I change my mind and say yes, then I need to take full responsibility for the consequences.
| Other people have the right to ask me anything, no matter how ridiculous or harmful to myself, but it is my responsibility to protect myself and what is important to me.


unequal pricing
---------------
| 2015-05-09
| When a taxi attendant asks you questions about 
| where you are from,
| where you are going,
| when is your flight,
| he is trying to decide how much to charge you.


time cushion
------------
| 2015-05-09
| A generous time cushion is important when events are unpredictable and uncontrollable.
| With more time, there are more options; you can negotiate and relax.
| Being relaxed is good for your health.


keep your family and business completely separated

| 2015-06-04

| What are you good at?
| Is there someone who might enjoy doing the work that you dislike?
| How would you define success for this project?


smaller tasks
-------------
| 2015-07-20
| The less I can concentrate, the smaller my tasks must be.


while I can
-----------
| 2015-08-07
| Time passes. You might be here, but so far away. And I feel guilty for not having kept my promises, even to myself. When will I reach my goals? Why do I often lose focus? Please forgive me, but I will do better today bit by bit while I can.


punctual progress
-----------------
| 2015-09-20
| As long as I'm closer and closer to being on time with my promises, there is progress.


deadlines
---------
| 2015-10-10
| Maybe deadlines are the key to progress.


order of operations
-------------------
| 2015-10-16

secret to finishing
-------------------
| 2015-11-27
| By continually starting where you stopped, you will eventually finish.


aura of invincibility
---------------------
| 2015-12-03
| Spiritually weak means you keep finding yourself in a recurring nightmare situation.
| Spiritually strong means that you are able to steer your life in the direction you want.
|
| Those who are spiritually weak are easy to hurt, insult and manipulate and they do this to themselves; they trip themselves.
| Those who are spiritually strong are unshakable and radiate strength to others.
|
| The very spiritually strong have an aura of invincibility.


start start start start start start start
-----------------------------------------
| 2015-12-29
| Repeatedly try to stop destructive tasks by starting restorative tasks.
| Repeatedly try to start productive tasks.
| Keep setting the countdown timer for repeated attempts.


consent is bolder
-----------------
| 2016-02-18
| Getting verbal or physical consent is the bolder action because you make yourself vulnerable to the risk of rejection.
| It is possible to be ballsy and adventurous and get continual consent.
| The decision metric to choose the bolder action still holds.


opportunities now
-----------------
| 2016-02-24
| The truth is, there is no way for me to know whether things would have turned out better if I had taken a different path. The only thing to do is to take advantage of the opportunities that I have now.
| What do I really want?
| What are the opportunities that I have now?
| What can I do today to help myself tomorrow?


scope
-----
| 2016-03-01
| Scope and time frame define a project. If the scope changes, then it is a different project.


builder's morale
----------------
| 2016-03-02
| The key to getting the most creativity and productivity out of your builders is to motivate them with what the user needs rather than exert more control. Anything that decreases a builder's motivation or morale will hurt the long-term health of a project.


private
-------
| 2016-04-05
| Nothing shared is ever private.


let people speak for themselves
-------------------------------
| 2016-05-14

notes for team leaders
----------------------
| 2016-06-16
| Focus on results and the user's perspective; you do not need to know exactly how it works.
| Schedule a demo once every two weeks. The demo does not have to be fancy; even a command-line script is sufficient. Pay attention and provide positive feedback during demos to motivate and boost engineer morale. A safe and supportive environment is important. Avoid criticizing what is wrong as this causes people to blame each other; instead, focus on next steps and what you would like to see for the next demo.
| Avoid raising emergencies as this can be toxic to team morale and lead to burnout; cost is two weeks of unproductive recovery time for every week of high stress, or worse, loss of a valuable team member.
| Empower a trusted senior engineer to enforce code quality.
| Take time to learn the dream goals of each team member, then give a choice of missions that align with their dream goals.


rest to work
------------
| 2016-06-07
| The lesson that I keep forgetting is that working while exhausted is not a good use of time. If I am staring at the computer struggling to remember what I am trying to do, then make a small plan and go to sleep.


microplans
----------
| 2016-08-04
| A microplan defines microtasks that can each be completed under five minutes. Spending fifteen minutes in drafting a microplan for how I will spend the next thirty minutes results in much more focused execution. This is how I will combat the situation of being dazed and easily distracted.


promises
--------
| 2016-09-05
| Making promises is easier than keeping them.
| Be careful when making promises.
| Be careful when trusting people who make promises.


fire starter
------------
| 2017-01-29
| Starting work each day is like trying to start a fire. Sometimes the tinder is wet and it takes a long time for the fire to catch. Food is fuel.


live together
-------------
| 2017-02-01
| Every day spent without you is a missed connection. Life is meant to be lived together.


collaboration primer based on the explosive child
-------------------------------------------------
| 2017-02-08
| Instead of being authoritarian and forcing the person to do what I want,
| Instead of being hands off and letting the person do whatever the person wants,
| Repeat the person's concern to the person,
| Explain my concern,
| Invite the person to brainstorm solutions that work for the group.
| How can we solve this problem?
| Actions show which people and projects I am prioritizing.
| Respect the time of participants in a meeting by being prepared.
| Respect contributors by commenting instead of erasing or editing directly.
| Allocate time each day for communication because feedback can boost morale.


rules of conduct
----------------
| 2017-04-02
| Avoid telling people what to do.
| Ask each other questions about their long-term and short-term goals.
| Propose your plan using the mission template for what you want to do.
| Present your plan at the next team meeting.

| Today was a special day. It is one of those days that I will remember when times are difficult or sad. Thanks for making this memory.


time allocation
---------------
| 2017-09-07
| If I don't allocate time to do something, then it is logical I won't make much progress in it.

| Sleep well
| Eat meals

training leaders
----------------

realistic goals
---------------
| 2017-09-25

on teaching
-----------
| 2017-11-06
| Have your students fix their own mistakes.


on eating
---------
| 2017-11-12

pathfinding
-----------
| 2017-11-21

how to respond as a team
------------------------
| 2017-11-28
| Communicate proposed changes to our side before proposing changes to their side.


breaking the cycle
------------------
| 2017-11-30
| You can only break the cycle by changing yourself and exemplifying the habits you want to pass to your children.


how to calm yourself
--------------------
| 2017-12-08
| If too many things are happening at once, your brain might start panicking.
| To calm a panicking brain, you need to give it the sense that it is in control.
| If your brain can accurately predict what happens next, then it will feel like it is in control.
| Write the simplest task that you can do next, do it, mark that it is done.
| Listen to the same music on repeat.
| Do a repetitive physical exercise.


nice price
----------

dialogue check
--------------
| 2020-08-13
| The pattern seems to be that I act impulsively on my emotions when I have extreme stress and fear. And my natural inclination is to push people away and withdraw from people in order to protect myself. Somehow I need to figure out how to replace withdrawal with dialogue as the standard reflex to fear. Another modification is to add a dialogue check before taking extreme actions. The way to implement this modification is by making it a habit to draft a plan before taking any kind of extreme action. And the first step on that plan is to have it be reviewed by someone else.

It does not make sense for me to dwell in the past and make more mistakes in the future. I must quiet these bothersome and painful thoughts and forget forget forget so that I can focus on a brighter future.

| Stopping: When your brain is on autopilot, it is important to know how to stop. Write a simple task, then do it and cross it out. Repeat until you have regained control.
| Maintenance: In both cases, changing course or reprogramming your brain is like starting a fire. There will be inertia as new instructions try to replace old instructions. Keep setting sparks to the tinder while supplying oxygen until the kindle alights. Don't forget to eat and sleep.

| For each act, ask yourself -- will this take me closer to my goals?


impact over technology
----------------------
| 2021-12-11
